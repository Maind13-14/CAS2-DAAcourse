Description and fabrication process
--------

Two main parts compose the system; the first is the vertical rail that is the main support on which the device (the second part) is fixed and can slide.

The vertical rail is constructed around a two meter joist. An aluminum L profile is screwed on each side. On the front, the main wooden board to write the marks on. On the right side, the gear rack rail is glued inside the milled groove along the joist.

The device has a back part and a front part. The back one hold down all the mechanical components: four wheels mounted on ball-bearings that allow the device to smoothly slide on the two aluminum profiles, the potentiometer to detect the height thanks to a gear mounted on its shaft that turns on the rack rail and finally, the braking system composed by two wood pieces tightly screwed together on the left aluminum profile to keep the device in place.

All the mechanics is held in place on two laser cut wood structure (one for each side) fixed on the front part of the device. There, a layered structure is designed to provide space for the tablet, the electronics and the wooden measuring board that can slide in and out. A wood frame hides the whole pile of sheets of the layered structure. The frame is divided in two parts; the bottom one is glued and the top one has a magnet on each side that clamps on the structure, so that it can be easily removed to access the inside components.
The knob is fixed on the top frame.

A Plexiglas sheet covers the whole frontal part of the device to enhance its design.
