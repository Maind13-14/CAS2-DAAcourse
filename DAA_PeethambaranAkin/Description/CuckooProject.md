##Abstract##

A clock, which forecasts weather and temperature for 5 days and for 5 different cities. The clock is a modern derivative of the classic cuckoo clock, in this particular design for 8 different weather conditions there are 8 different birds associated. 

##Interface and Interaction Modality##
The weather cuckoo clock is similar in design to a cuckoo clock. The user interacts with the device to configure the city as well as the day of forecast. The city is selected using a knob on the side of the clock. The day for forecast is selected by pulling a chain hanging from the same. The clock is connected to a surrounding Wi-Fi network to read the weather from the Internet.The birds and the associated music give an indication to the user about the weather condition. ##User Experience##
The product maintains the existing clock interaction just modifying the bird and the sound depending on the weather. The temperature can be read from the rotating temperature indicator.
