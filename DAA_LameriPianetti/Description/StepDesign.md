Step Design
##Description and Fabrication Process##

Step's design it's simple and clean. We wanted kids to understand without explanations how to use Step but at the same time to keep the visual shape of professional step sequencers.
The whole board is designed to turn the attention to the functional parts (the knob, the button and the tags). The sides are painted in gray and the wooden top is left unpainted. The position of the tags define the loop and in somehow the create a phisical visualization of it.
