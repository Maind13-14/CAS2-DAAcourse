##Description##
The project recognizes the color of the tags thanks to 25 CNY70 IR Sensors. These sensors are placed in a grid. Each one has an IR led that is always on, and a sensor that is checked every time a sound should be played. To achive that each sensor had to be connectod to a pin in the arduino. In order to connect so many pins to the arduino we used the MUX Shield II, mounted on the Arduino Leonardo. The Arduino also reads a potentiometer and a button. The Arduino communicates with a laptop, sends information about the sensors, potentiometer and button and receives information about which led to light up.
The laptop is also used to record and produce de sound. The laptop has an external USB sound card connected to the microphone and the speaker. The speaker uses a disassembled desktop speaker system's amp to enhance the sound.
